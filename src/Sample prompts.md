Short Prompt:
 A photorealistic image of a professional female news anchor of Middle Eastern descent, wearing a navy-blue blazer with an MBZUAI logo pin and an off-white blouse, seated at a studio desk with hands gently clasped. She has a calm, confident expression, dark brown eyes, and neatly tied-back hair. The background is a sleek, modern newsroom in blue tones with soft lighting and slight depth blur. On the right, a clean white screen displays the MBZUAI logo and the headline "June 2025 AI News" in bold black text. The shot is waist-up, well-lit, and composed for high realism.

Detailed Version:
A photorealistic studio news-anchor scene:

– Subject: a poised female presenter of Middle-Eastern heritage, early-30s, natural light-tan complexion, deep-brown eyes, neat dark-brown hair pulled into a low ponytail. She faces camera front-on, calm confident expression, faint closed-lip smile. Hands gently clasped on the desk.

– Wardrobe: tailored navy-blue blazer with a single button, lapel pinned with a small square MBZUAI logo badge; off-white crew-neck blouse underneath.

– Setting: modern broadcast newsroom rendered in cool blue hues. Depth-of-field softly blurs modular wall panels and subtle LED rim lights.

– Framing: medium shot (waist-up), 3:2 aspect, anchor on left third of frame; right third reserved for a large, edge-lit information screen.

– Screen content: upper-left corner features the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence wordmark and blue-teal hex-node logo; beneath it, bold black text reads “June 2025 AI News” in two lines, centre-aligned on white background.

– Lighting: balanced three-point setup (key at 45° camera-left, soft fill, cool kicker from behind), yielding gentle facial highlights and crisp suit texture.

– Style & quality: ultra-realistic 8-k photographic detail, neutral colour grading, no film grain, sharp focus on anchor, slight bokeh on background, high dynamic range.

– Camera specs: DSLR, 50 mm lens, f/2.8, ISO 100, shutter 1/125 s.
